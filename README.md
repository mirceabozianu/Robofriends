Front-end project built with React.js:
- The interface can recieve user data;
- For every user received it creates a Card;
- Every Card has an unique Robot and it's own data;
- You can search through the robots to find the one that you need;

This project helped me familiarize with:
- The JSX syntax used by React.js;
- Building smart components and components in general;
- importing libraries such as 'tachyons';
